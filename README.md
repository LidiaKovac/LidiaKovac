### 💬 Currently working on...
As I have now graduated from Strive School (capstone <a href="https://learn-ez.netlify.app">HERE</a> is you are curious, you can also visit the <a href="https://github.com/LidiaKovac/learning-management-system-FE">repository</a>), I am trying a number of different things. I share all my progress here, under x-101 repositories (e.g. my PHP-101 repo). 

When I am not coding, I am focusing on my bachelor in languages and getting ready to enroll in a Digital Humanities MD. 

Here is a list of things I am interested in. Keep in mind these are only topics I want to know more about, I might or might not deep dive in these. 

- Python, AI, Machine Learning, especially vis-a-vis humanities (poetry, translation, art)
- Game Development
- Svelte 
- IOT, Raspeberry Pi and Arduino


### 🏋️‍♀️ In my free time... 

In my free time I am a crossfitter, avid gamer and language student. I am currently enrolled in university for a bachelor in modern languages and cultures, which will be followed by a Digital Humanities master and, why not, a Digital Humanities doctorate.
