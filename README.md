### 💬 Currently working on...
[My solo capstone!](https://github.com/LidiaKovac/learning-management-system-FE)
I'm building a learning management system catered to both students and educators where you can have all your school materials organized in the same place. 
I want to focus a lot on accessibility, so feel free to pop some suggestions! 🌱

### 🏋️‍♀️ In my free time... 

In my free time I am a crossfitter, avid gamer and language student. I am currently enrolled in university for a bachelor in modern languages and cultures, which will be followed by a Digital Humanities master and, why not, a Digital Humanities doctorate.
