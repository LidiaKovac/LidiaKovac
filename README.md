### 💬 Currently working on...
As I have now graduated from Strive School (capstone <a href="https://learn-ez.netlify.app">HERE</a> is you are curious, you can also visit the <a href="https://github.com/LidiaKovac/learning-management-system-FE">repository</a>), I am trying a number of different things. I share all my progress here, under x-101 repositories (e.g. my PHP-101 repo). 

When I am not coding, I am focusing on my bachelor in languages and getting ready to enroll in a Digital Humanities MD. 

Here is a list of things I am interested in. Keep in mind these are only topics I want to know more about, I might or might not deep dive in these. 

- Python, AI, Machine Learning, especially around humanities (poetry, translation, art)
- Game Development
- Some kind of desktop apps (like Electron)
- IOT, Raspeberry Pi and Arduino

#### List of 101 repos (will hopefully grow bigger soon 📚!): 
**Key**: 

🛑 Gave up, did not enjoy or it was too hard 

⏰ Still ongoing

✔️ Done! 


| Topic     | Enjoyment (1/5) | State
| ----------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| <a href="https://github.com/LidiaKovac/PHP-101">Vanilla PHP</a>     |   ⭐⭐     | 🛑
| <a href="https://github.com/LidiaKovac/JS_GameDev-101">JS Game Dev</a>   |  ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐      | ✔️

### 🏋️‍♀️ In my free time... 

In my free time I am a crossfitter, avid gamer and language student. I am currently enrolled in university for a bachelor in modern languages and cultures, which will be followed by a Digital Humanities master and, why not, a Digital Humanities doctorate.
