### Who am I?

Hi! My name is Lidia and I am a Teaching Assistant at EPICODE (Global and Italy). I have a linguistic background which I use to approach programming languages as natural languages with their own vocabulary, grammar and syntaxes. 
I also studied art in high school, which makes me much more prone to doing frontend rather than backend (Yes, I may have lied before. Sorry to my backend teacher.).
I am currently focussing primarily on teaching and building my own projects!

### üí¨ Currently working on...

#### DnD As A Service

This project was born from my passion for D&D and role playing, which brings many challenges. One of many, building your character sheet. There are some paid services out there, specifically from Wizard itself, and some free versions, which are PDF based and very slow. 
The goal with this project would be to build a cloud-based app that makes character sheets faster to build. 
I am currently working on the backend, collecting DnD 5e data in a database to serve it on the frontend.

#### Dikter Management System - DMS
##### News! This project is currently "paused" as I am diving deeper into the DnD As A Service project.

I started this as a small research for a literature exam involving collecting poetry from various sources and cataloguing them by keywords. 
At the moment, I am using bootstrap for the layout, as it is not a front-end centered project and I needed a quick solution. 
For the backend, I am using node paired with MongoDB to collect the data and the <b>node-nlp</b> library to perform NLP operations such as removing stopwords and stemming the text. 
In the future I am planning on implementing more statistics to filter by year and add more authors as well as more ways to upload poems, possibily choosing to use a python microservice to do some OCR.

  <hr/>

Here is a list of things I am interested in. Keep in mind these are only topics I want to know more about, I might or might not deep dive in these. 

- Python, AI, Machine Learning, especially around humanities (poetry, translation, art)
- Game Development
- Some kind of desktop apps (like Electron)
- IOT, Raspeberry Pi and Arduino


### üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è In my free time... 

In my free time I do musical performances, dance and, when time if on my side, I play videogames. 
I am currently enrolled in university for a bachelor in modern languages and cultures, which will be followed by a Digital Humanities master and, why not, a Digital Humanities doctorate.
